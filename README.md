# Python-Tkinter-CRUD-Application-
Iâ€™m excited to share a project I've been working on: a Simple CRUD Application built with Python's Tkinter and SQLite.
What It Does:
Create: Add new records to a SQLite database.
Read: Fetch and display records in a user-friendly interface.
Update & Delete: (To be implemented) Modify or remove records from the database.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Intuitive GUI: Designed with Tkinter, offering a clean and simple interface.
SQLite Integration: Efficiently handles database operations with SQLite.
Dynamic Table: Displays records with a scrollable Treeview widget.
ðŸ”¹ Technology Stack:
Python
Tkinter for GUI
SQLite for database management
ðŸ”¹ Why This Project? This application is a great example of how Python can be used to build practical, user-friendly applications. It demonstrates essential CRUD operations while incorporating error handling, validation, and user feedback.
ðŸ”¹ Next Steps: Iâ€™m planning to add update and delete functionalities, improve data validation, and enhance security features such as password encryption.
